Open Project, CS316 Fall 2024

This repository contains our final project (open) for CS316 (Intro to Database Systems) in the Fall 2024 semester. Our project focuses on creating a collaborative platform designed for Duke residents and residential staff to efficiently access and manage available HRL resources.

Progress Since Milestone 2: 
- Assigned tasks to each team member (see report)
- Repository created @ https://github.com/34jasonguan/cs316-open-project 
- Updated readme according to milestone specifications
- Installed next.js, created basic next project in repository
- Shared schemas for all tables in database; created database populated with randomly generated student data
- Updated UI design
- Developed an account system and a functional login access page
- Implemented a search page which filters and fetches information from the database
- Implemented an activity proposal page which writes to DB
- Implemented safety report submission function which writes to DB

Implementation: 
Our project is currently running using a tech stack of Next.js (frontend) and SQLite (DB). All of our code for the APIs and frontend widgets can be found in the 'src' folder: the 'pages' folder contains all of the javascript code which forms our frontend, while the 'api' folder within 'pages' contains all of the api routing for fetching data from the SQLite database.
