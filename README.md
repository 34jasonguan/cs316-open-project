Members: Jason Guan, Jiayu (Gloria) Gao, Raymond Xiong, Shuhuai Yu, Sudhir Chowdhry -- Open Project, CS316 Fall 2024

This repository contains our final project (open) for CS316 (Intro to Database Systems) in the Fall 2024 semester. Our project, ResiDevils, focuses on creating a collaborative platform designed for Duke residents and residential staff to efficiently access and manage available HRL resources.

Total Progress: 
- Assigned tasks to each team member (see report)
- Repository created @ https://github.com/34jasonguan/cs316-open-project 
- Updated readme according to milestone specifications
- Installed next.js and Prisma, created a database in PostgreSQL populated with mostly randomly generated data
- Designed an intuitive UI styled after existing Duke platforms
- Developed an account system and a functional login page
- Implemented a search page which filters and fetches information from the database
- Implemented safety report and activity proposal pages which write to the DB
- Implemented RA availability function including calendar interaction
- Connected frontend components to a database in PostgreSQL using Prisma ORM

Implementation: 
Our project is currently running using a tech stack of Next.js (frontend) and PostgreSQL (DB) connected using the ORM Prisma. All of our code for the APIs and frontend widgets can be found in the 'src' folder: the 'pages' folder contains all of the javascript code which forms our frontend, while the 'api' folder within 'pages' contains all of the api routes which are used for fetching data from the PostgreSQL database.
