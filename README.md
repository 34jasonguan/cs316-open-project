Open Project, CS316 Fall 2024

This repository contains our final project (open) for CS316 (Intro to Database Systems) in the Fall 2024 semester. Our project focuses on creating a collaborative platform designed for Duke residents and residential staff to efficiently access and manage available HRL resources.

Progress Since Milestone 2: 
- Assigned tasks to each team member (see report)
- Repository created @ https://github.com/34jasonguan/cs316-open-project 
- Updated readme according to milestone specifications
- Installed next.js, created basic next project in repository
- Created components for home page, navigation bar, etc.
- Uploaded schemas for users information and activities
- Created database populated with fictitious student data
- Developed an account system and a functional login access page
- Implemented safety report submission function including some templates
- Implemented RA availability function including calendar interaction
- Connected frontend components to database, allowing for writing/fetching from DB
- Updated UI design, created a development page to test DB interactions

Implementation: 
Our project is currently running using a tech stack of Next.js (frontend) and SQLite (DB). All of our code for the APIs and frontend widgets can be found in the 'src' folder: the 'pages' folder contains all of the javascript code which forms our frontend, while the 'api' folder within 'pages' contains all of the api routing for fetching data from the SQLite database.
